## Background

The goal of this assignment is to create a webpage with R Markdown that features a map created with leaflet. The specific map could be any place. It must be hosted on GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 

```{r load}
library(leaflet)
```


```{r map, echo=FALSE}
m_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()   
m_map <- m_map %>% addMarkers(lat= 42.2936, lng= -71.3059, popup="A great education")
m_map 
```
